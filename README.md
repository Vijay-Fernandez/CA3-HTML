Design Rationale


Navigation:

For navigation I added a navigation bar at the top of the website, due to the websites small size and content, this will be one of the first elements the user sees, helped by how the bar stretches across the entire page and is located directly under the banner. The buttons also change colour to let the user know what page they are currently on.


Layout:

The website follows a very simple layout, with both the home and history page featuring a block of text beneath the banner and navigation bar. Images are usually to the left of the screen as users read from left to right so they can find the text first. This was deliberate and was done to keep the website consistent across pages. This changes somewhat in the visit page which has the main part of the page, being the tourist attractions, featured first as that is the reason why the user would visit that page of the website. 


Colour choice:

The website follows a grey/black/white colour scheme, with the navigation bar's current page display and website banner being an exception. This was done so that the banner would stand out with its blue tartan pattern, and the blue colour used on the navigation bar was so the user would easily know what part of the website they were on. Grey was chosen as the main colour of the website due to Aberdeen's nickname of the "Granite City", so the colout was chosen to play into this theme, which is why the motto used in the banner was "The Granite City"


Challenges faced:

I had a lot of problems with the visit page, with implementing bootstrap in a way that looked pleasing to the user. At first I planned to use buttons to showcase different attractions, but then decided on the card method used in the final version of the page. I also had problems with the layout, trying to find a way that made it easy to read and navigate to the user, eventually I chose to go for a very simple layout as the website's content allowed it.
